        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Clear View was a concept developed in the course “User Experience II: Iteration” at UCLA Extension. The app seeks to help reduce climate change by making it easier for users to find and rate local businesses that are environmentally responsible.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>From our research we learned that almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions comes from the Industry Economic sector (which includes manufacturing and commercial businesses) and the electricity that powers those companies. We also learned that most consumers will buy products that have a social environmental benefit and will boycott brands making irresponsible business decisions.</p>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Since consumers aren’t the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and can greatly influence businesses, we wanted to find a way to hold businesses accountable for their impact on the environment. Our solution was to create an app where users can find and rate local businesses based on their environmental responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>The main audience for this app are people who are environmentally conscious and ethical consumers. From our interviews, we found that there were four types of users, ranging from the complete newbie to the more experienced activist.</p>

        <p class="pt-3">The main user we focused on was Greta who is somewhere in the middle. Like most of the people interviewed, she is already taking steps to reduce her carbon footprint, but wants to do more by making responsible purchases.
        </p>

        <p>Her main frustrations when trying to find businesses to support are:</p>
        <ul class="px-5 pb-3">
          <li>When searching for green businesses, there is an overwhelming amount of information to sift through.</li>
          <li>Information on these businesses are unclear i.e. what exactly are they doing that's green?</li>
          <li>Search results sometimes are incorrect and list a business as green, but they aren't.</li>

    <div class="row justify-content-center design mt-5">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The initial idea for the app was that each business gets a number rating from 1-5, of how green they are (5 being the highest). The user can then filter their search results on green features a company might have and they can also go to the company page to see how they got their green score. They would also be able to rate the company and are given directions on what things to look out for.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">First Iteration</h3>
        <figure class="figure py-3">
          <img src="./images/cv_lofidelity.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Image of the initial lo-fidelity wireframes of the app."> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Lo-fidelity wireframes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h4>User Feedback:</h4>
        <p>After testing the wireframes on 5 users, the main takeaways were that the user flow and navigation was unclear and more information was needed for the detailed search result and search filter</p>
        <h4>Updates:</h4>
        <p>A description was then added underneath the navigation items and the navigation pages were built out. More information was added to the search filter options such as sort and price. Also added more info to the detailed search result such as map, hours, contact info, reviews etc.</p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Second Iteration</h3>
        <figure class="figure py-3">
          <img src="./images/cv_hifidelity.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Image of the high-fidelity wireframes for the app."> <figcaption class="figure-caption">High-fidelity wireframes</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>User Feedback:</h4>
        <p>After testing again, the feedback received was that the number rating system was unclear and the user couldn’t tell what the score meant. They also felt there was too much green and the user couldn’t tell if dark green was supposed to be good or bad. In terms of design, the app felt crowded and the serif font used was difficult to read. Also, the icons were all different sizes.
        </p>
        <h4>Updates:</h4>
        <p>So for the final design, the number rating system was changed to a “5 leaf” rating system similar to a 5 star rating. The use of green was scaled back and brown was used as a secondary color as a reference to trees and plants. More white space was created by using an 8 pixel grid and icons are now uniform in size.
        </p>
        <h4>Design Library:</h4>
        <figure class="figure py-3">
          <img src="./images/cv_designlibrary.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Image of the design library for the app."> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Design library</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A more cohesive design library was created for the app also. The font was changed from a mixture of Serif and Sans Serif fonts to just the sans serif font Proxima Nova as it’s designed for web use and has better legibility. The colors chosen are also AAA compliant when viewed on a white background at varying font sizes.</p>
